        <strong>Welcome to Deep Impact</strong> ‚Äî a machine learning‚Äìpowered dashboard for analyzing the potential threat posed by Near-Earth Objects (NEOs).
        This tool predicts a kinetic-energy‚Äìbased risk score using inputs like velocity, magnitude, and diameter, simulating how catastrophic an asteroid would be if it were on a collision course with Earth.
        The project uses real asteroid parameters, physics-based approximations of impact energy, and a trained Random Forest model to classify threat levels ranging from negligible to highly hazardous.

    Based on the input parameters ‚Äî a **velocity of {velocity_mps:,.2f} m/s**, an **absolute magnitude of {magnitude:.2f}**, and an **average diameter of {diameter_m:,.2f} meters**, the asteroid‚Äôs **kinetic energy** has been estimated using its average size and speed. This results in a predicted **risk score of {predicted_risk:.8f}**, which reflects the potential severity of impact if such an object were heading toward Earth. Given its physical characteristics, this asteroid could carry significant momentum ‚Äî and depending on its composition, entry angle, and atmospheric interaction, it may either disintegrate or survive entry and cause considerable damage. The object is classified as a **{risk_category}** risk under the assumption of an Earth-impacting orbit. {risk_summary_line}\n\n
