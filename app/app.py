    <strong>Welcome to Deep Impact</strong> ‚Äî a machine learning powered dashboard for analyzing the potential threat posed by asteroids.
    This tool estimates a kinetic-energy‚Äìbased risk score using user-provided inputs such as velocity, absolute magnitude, and diameter ‚Äî simulating the projected impact effects of an asteroid assuming a direct Earth-bound trajectory. The model leverages real-world asteroid data, applies physics-based impact estimations, and uses a trained Random Forest regressor to classify the object into intuitive threat levels ranging from negligible to highly hazardous.
    Use the form below to experiment with hypothetical asteroid scenarios and explore how their impact profiles compare to those of real NEOs monitored by NASA. ‚òÑÔ∏èüõ∞Ô∏è

        "üü° Low": "With modest size and velocity, this asteroid may partially survive atmospheric entry, but would likely fragment at high altitudes due to thermal stress and pressure differences. While it could produce a small airburst or sonic boom, the likelihood of ground impact or substantial damage remains very low.",
        "üü† Elevated": "Due to its larger size and kinetic energy, this asteroid could survive atmospheric entry, especially if composed of dense materials like metal or rock. Upon entry, it might decelerate but remain intact enough to reach the ground, causing localized impact effects such as shockwaves, crater formation, or structural damage in populated zones. Its threat potential increases significantly if its entry angle is shallow or its trajectory intersects urban regions.",
        "üî¥ High": "This asteroid possesses substantial mass and velocity, making it capable of withstanding intense aerodynamic heating during atmospheric entry. Its kinetic energy would be largely retained upon descent, allowing it to impact the Earth's surface with catastrophic force. Depending on the location and composition, it could lead to regional-scale destruction, including shockwaves, thermal radiation, fires, and long-lasting environmental effects."

        <strong>Deep Impact</strong> is an interactive machine learning dashboard that models, simulates, and classifies the potential threat posed by Near-Earth Objects (NEOs), including asteroids and comets whose orbits bring them into close proximity with Earth. The project integrates astrophysical modeling, data science techniques, and supervised machine learning methods to create a scientifically grounded, interpretable risk estimation platform. It uses real-world observational data sourced from NASA‚Äôs Near-Earth Object database, focusing on key features such as encounter velocity, estimated diameter from optical reflectivity measurements, and absolute magnitude as an indicator of intrinsic brightness. These parameters are selected for their direct physical relevance to impact outcomes, where kinetic energy serves as a critical determinant of destructive potential. Feature engineering refines the raw measurements by averaging minimum and maximum diameter estimates, standardizing all inputs to promote stable model learning, and emphasizing velocity given its quadratic influence on energy release. Deep Impact applies a Random Forest Regressor to predict a kinetic energy‚Äìbased risk score for each simulated object, translating continuous outputs into discrete hazard levels calibrated against historical asteroid impact events including the Tunguska (1908) and Chelyabinsk (2013) incidents. The platform bridges physics-based reasoning with machine learning predictions to offer accessible yet rigorous risk assessments.
        <br><br>
        Model development emphasizes scientific accuracy, physical interpretability, and predictive robustness. The Random Forest model is selected for its ensemble-based approach, which captures complex, non-linear relationships between asteroid characteristics while resisting overfitting through variance reduction across decision trees. A logarithmic transformation of kinetic energy is employed as the target variable to accommodate the broad dynamic range of impact energies, from minor airbursts to globally significant collisions. Hyperparameter tuning is conducted via grid search and k-fold cross-validation, optimizing model parameters such as maximum tree depth, minimum samples per split, and the number of estimators to achieve a balance between model complexity and generalization ability. Evaluation using metrics such as the coefficient of determination (R¬≤), mean absolute error (MAE), and root mean squared error (RMSE) confirms the model‚Äôs high predictive accuracy and stable behavior across validation sets. Feature importance analysis aligns with theoretical kinetic energy relationships, highlighting velocity as the dominant predictor, followed by diameter, both of which critically affect mass and energy calculations. Absolute magnitude provides secondary predictive value by constraining uncertainty in size estimation, especially for objects with incomplete observational profiles.
        <br><br>
        The dashboard, developed using the Streamlit framework, enables users to explore a wide range of hypothetical asteroid impact scenarios by adjusting physical input parameters and observing real-time updates to predicted kinetic energy outputs and hazard classifications. Through dynamic user interaction, the system illustrates fundamental astrophysical principles such as the sensitivity of impact severity to small changes in velocity and mass, reinforcing concepts like the quadratic velocity dependence of kinetic energy. Deep Impact demonstrates how machine learning models, when informed by domain-specific physics, can serve as effective, scalable tools for preliminary planetary defense analyses. The platform provides an accessible interface that bridges detailed scientific modeling with public understanding, offering users insight into the mechanisms driving asteroid impact threats. Future extensions of the project aim to incorporate additional orbital parameters such as eccentricity and inclination, material composition proxies, and probabilistic uncertainty modeling to refine risk predictions further and contribute to the ongoing development of space hazard assessment technologies. üöÄüåç
