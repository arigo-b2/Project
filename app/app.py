    <strong>Welcome to Deep Impact</strong> ‚Äî a machine learning powered dashboard for analyzing the potential threat posed by asteroids.
    This tool estimates a kinetic-energy‚Äìbased risk score using user-provided inputs such as velocity, absolute magnitude, and diameter ‚Äî simulating the projected impact effects of an asteroid assuming a direct Earth-bound trajectory. The model leverages real-world asteroid data, applies physics-based impact estimations, and uses a trained Random Forest regressor to classify the object into intuitive threat levels ranging from negligible to highly hazardous.
    Use the form below to experiment with hypothetical asteroid scenarios and explore how their impact profiles compare to those of real NEOs monitored by NASA. ‚òÑÔ∏èüõ∞Ô∏è

        "üü° Low": "With modest size and velocity, this asteroid may partially survive atmospheric entry, but would likely fragment at high altitudes due to thermal stress and pressure differences. While it could produce a small airburst or sonic boom, the likelihood of ground impact or substantial damage remains very low.",
        "üü† Elevated": "Due to its larger size and kinetic energy, this asteroid could survive atmospheric entry, especially if composed of dense materials like metal or rock. Upon entry, it might decelerate but remain intact enough to reach the ground, causing localized impact effects such as shockwaves, crater formation, or structural damage in populated zones. Its threat potential increases significantly if its entry angle is shallow or its trajectory intersects urban regions.",
        "üî¥ High": "This asteroid possesses substantial mass and velocity, making it capable of withstanding intense aerodynamic heating during atmospheric entry. Its kinetic energy would be largely retained upon descent, allowing it to impact the Earth's surface with catastrophic force. Depending on the location and composition, it could lead to regional-scale destruction, including shockwaves, thermal radiation, fires, and long-lasting environmental effects."

            <strong>Deep Impact</strong> is a machine learning‚Äìpowered dashboard built to explore, interpret, and communicate the potential threat of Near-Earth Objects (NEOs) ‚Äî celestial bodies like asteroids and comets whose orbits bring them close to Earth‚Äôs neighborhood.  <br><br>

            This project was developed as part of an applied data science initiative, combining astronomy, physics, and machine learning to simulate what could happen if an asteroid were on a direct collision course with planet Earth. It serves both as a scientific tool and a public education interface ‚Äî helping users understand how asteroid parameters such as velocity, brightness (absolute magnitude), and size contribute to the severity of impact events.  

            Using a trained Random Forest regression model, the system predicts a kinetic energy‚Äìbased risk score, approximating how much energy an object would release upon impact. This score is then translated into qualitative threat levels, providing intuitive insight into what might otherwise be abstract astrophysical calculations.  

            Built with real orbital and physical data from NASA‚Äôs Near-Earth Object database, <em>Deep Impact</em> empowers users to experiment with hypothetical asteroid scenarios ‚Äî tweaking input values and seeing how even subtle changes in speed or size can lead to dramatically different risk classifications.  

            Ultimately, this project aims to showcase the intersection of machine learning and planetary defense, while making space hazard analysis more accessible, engaging, and interactive for everyone. üöÄüåç
